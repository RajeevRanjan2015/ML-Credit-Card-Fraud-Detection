# ML-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
To create and compare different Machine Learning model's accuracy that can classify fraudlent and non fraudlent credit card transactions.

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. 

Two models trained to label anonymized credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. With Logistic Regression + PCA we achieved 99.92% accuracy wile with Random Forest + PCA we achieved 99.95% accuracy rate.
